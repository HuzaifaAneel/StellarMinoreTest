# Welcome to the API Template created for your use by Stellar Minore LLC.

This project is based on ExpressJS, running Node. It is meant to be a quick way for you to spin up a new API repo, without having to jump through the same hoops every time. Our team decided to OpenSource this API template that we were using every time we spun up a new template so that we can help others get running as well.

## Features

This project comes with a few things setup by default including

### Sign up API end points
### Database configurations for different environments
### Linter predefined with rules
### And more!

If there are any recommended changes then please feel free to open a pull request!

Now don't just sit there looking pretty--clone this repo and get to work!
